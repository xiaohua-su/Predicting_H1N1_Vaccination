# Predicting seasonal Flu Shots


## Overview
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's important that we are able to predict if someone recieved a vaccine. Being able to predict who is likely going to get a vaccine shot is crucial as this will give insight into who are potentially features that may make a person more likely to be vaccinated. As such, targetted approach can be taken to help increase these odds.

The IL Department of Public Health is trying to create a model that will predict who has gotten a vaccine. Using the information provided in the 2009 H1N1 survey, on DrivenData.org, I seek to produce a model that is able to predict whether someone has gotten the H1N1 vaccine based on the data in the survey. 

## Problem
The CDC has tasked us to create a model that can accurately predict whether someone has gotten the H1N1 vaccine.

## Data
The data used was taken from DrivenData, which contains some basic information about an individual such as their `age_group`, opinions on H1N1 and the seasonal flu vaccines, and some behaviors. This survey was performed betwenn October 2009 to June 2010, when H1N1 was declared a pandemic.   

## Methods
This project use classifcation algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision trees and ensembles algorithms such as voting classification. Columns such as `race` was removed from the data set to ensure that when we pull out features and or interpret our model, it will not have this racial bias included in it. 


## Results



## Conclusion



## Next Steps
- Be able to examine the `hhs_geo_region` more closely -understandable that this dataset given to me had the regions in randomized strings to ensure even more privacy
